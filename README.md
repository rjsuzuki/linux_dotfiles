## ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT

1. Go to git folder and modify `.gitconfig` with your own information.
2. Review the `.vimrc` file and edit as needed to fit your preferences.
3. Only source `install.sh` or `configure.sh` files. `install.sh` is for system wide coverage of settings, while `configure.sh` files are for quickly updating specific modules.
4. Edit the 'binary switches' inside the `install.sh` file to turn ON/OFF the installation of a specific module. accepted values are `0` and `1`.
5. After installation, you can run the cmd `help` in the terminal to print out a list of the custom aliases that were configured. If you add additional aliases and/or exports, you can update the `help.sh` for your own reference.
6. I really gave up on the `bash` related files because I like `zsh` so much more. So use bash at your own discretion.
7. When you need to update a `.zsh` file, simply run
```bash
cd $HOME
source ~/.dotfiles/zsh/configure.sh
```
Successful updates will print out `owari` in the terminal. It means `done` in üáØüáµ.
